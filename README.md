# Decentralized Open Science

The Decentralized Open Science Subgroup, consisting of Marco Beck, Cornelius Ihle, and Dennis Trautwein, employs decentralized information technology to foster the open science movement.
Open Science, as, e.g., described in the [twelfe Vienna principles](https://viennaprinciples.org/) aim to make scientific processes more transparent and results more accessible.
However, there are many incentives to abstain from doing Open Science that require confidentiality to keep a competitive advantages.
We believe that surpassing inherently scientific incentives are critical for a self-sustaining open science ecosystem.

Free and Open Source Software can look back on an impressive success story.
A success that introduced new incentives like faster development, faster innovation, and improved reliability.
We expect similar positive effects on open science.
Building tools (Open Source Software) for interdisciplinary Open Science is a logical resulting consequence.

Decentralization is the final iteration towards transparency and openness that we strive for.
We want to eliminate data silos and the dependency on nontransparent central service providers.
