# Decentralized Open Science

The Decentralized Open Science Subgroup consisting of Marco Beck, Cornelius Ihle, and Dennis Trautwein employ the power of decentralized information technology to foster the open science movement.
Open Science, as, e.g., described in the [twelfe Vienna principles](https://viennaprinciples.org/) describes noble goals.
However, there are many incentives to abstain from doing Open Science or only to pretend to work openly in practice.
